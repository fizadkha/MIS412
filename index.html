            if you're lucky or connected, you can get an invite, sans the price
            tag. But I wasn't so lucky or connected my first two years, so i'm here
            to help you out. First, plan out which shows ae most important to you and
            make a schedule, and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you're worried 
            about blowing your cash the whole time, you won't have fun. then check out 
            prices, days and times and proritize the designers you wante to see the most.
            Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!

            Always be true to your sense of style, if you don't, you'll be uncomfortable
            the whole time, and it will show. Remember, Paris Fashion Week is about expressing
            yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new
            lines. Also, it's important to wear shoes; you'll be comfortable all day. Obviously,
            you want to look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.
